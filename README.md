# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:
we have data of 15 different schools including 
Number of Students in each school
Total school budget of each school
Math and REading Scors of Students from Grade 9th to 12th of each school
Type of school whether it is district or carter.
   

## The purpose of this analysis

we have to analyse the data to find the following bellow
Does the higher budget of school has a positive impact on school performance? 
does the number of total students in each grade can effect the school performance?
Is there any positive/negative effect on performance of a school by the the Type?


## Results:
  
  
  ### Math and reading scores by grade:
   Everage scores of all the schools by grades are almost similer.
   ### Scores by school spending:
   higher school budget or higher per student budget does not effect school performance .
   ### Scores by school size:
   school size has defenetly a slight impact on the school performance. almost all the  schools having higher number of studens shows comparatively lower overall passing    ratios.
   ### Scores by school type:
   All the districts schools results are poor than Charter school.

## Summary:
  There is quite a difference in results according to school type.All the Charters schools show much better results than District schools.
  Increasing the budget of school does not improve the performace of a school.Increasing the numer of District schools to reduce the nubrer of students in each grade       would improve the performance of District school.
