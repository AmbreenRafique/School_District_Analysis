# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:
We have below data for 15 schools in the district: 
-  Number of students in each school
-  Total school budget
-  Math and Reading scores of students from Grade 9th to 12th at each school
-  'Type' of school whether it is district or carter.
   
## The purpose of this analysis

We have to analyse the data to find the following information:
-  Does higher budget of school has a positive impact on school's performance? 
-  Do the number of total students in each grade effect school's performance?
-  Is there any positive/negative effect on performance of a school by the 'Type'?

## Results:
  
  ### Math and Reading scores by grade:
   Average Math and Reading scores of schools by grades are almost similer.
   ### Scores by school spending:
   Higher school budget or higher per student budget does not affect school's performance .
   ### Scores by school size:
   School size has a slight impact on the school's performance. Almost all the schools having higher number of students show comparatively lower overall passing    ratios.
   ### Scores by school type:
   District school results are poor than Charter school.

## Summary:
  There is quite a difference in results according to school type. All the Charters schools show much better results than District schools.
  Increasing the budget of school does not improve the performace of a school. Increasing the number of District schools to reduce the nubrer of students in each grade       would improve the performance of District school.
